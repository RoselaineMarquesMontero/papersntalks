////
Liferay Portal has always been a feature rich application with thousands of features and options resulting in billions of possible deployment scenarios. However, regardless of configuration, Liferay's core is all or nothing. We'll discuss the strategy used to redesign Liferay for modularity to improve quality and maintainability while allowing optional features to be completely removed or easily updated.

* Push as much as we can into _shared_
* App server idiosyncrasies
* Protect impls through indirection
* Hundreds of wrapper APIs
* Statics became the norm

* Create a plugin runtime under Liferay's control
* Implement infrastructure support
* Emulate some of the App Server features

* Make sure that legacy apps (WARs) _can_ still work icon:angle-right[] provide for
** Auto conversion to OSGi (WAB)
** JSP support in OSGi
* In the process icon:angle-right[] Make a few enhancements
** Implement better dependency managment
** Publish SB services as OSGi services
** Eliminate SB service jar copying (go direct, don't need CLP)

* Easier configuration

* Monoliths are hard to maintain and have higher production costs.
* Modularity promotes isolation which promots re-use which promots innovation.
* Modularity reduces coupling which reduces maintenance costs which leads to satisifed users.

Liferay is doing whatever it can to increase productivity, reduce production and maintenance costs and to generally get out of your way while getting you to your goal faster.
