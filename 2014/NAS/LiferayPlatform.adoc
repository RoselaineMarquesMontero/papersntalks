== icon:th-list[] Core Values

Technologically, Liferay Portal is founded on a set of core values which allow
for a wide range of concerns to be checked off requirements lists. These alone
can give you considerable head start toward a project's goals.

* database agnostic
* application server agnostic
* standard integrations

<<<

== icon:th-list[] Baseline Services

On top those core values Liferay built an extremely useful set baseline
services, eliminating the need for projects to get caught up in their mundane,
uninspiring implementation. Liferay provides management of:

* users
* organizations
* permissions
* configuration
* sites
* pages
* page layout

<<<

== icon:th-list[] Canned Features

Add to this many canned features which the stock product provides.

* Web Content
* Documents & Media
* Collaboration
* Workflow
* Staging

<<<

== icon:th-list[] Special Initiatives

At one point Liferay began to be (_as any reasonably sized engineering team
eventually is_) faced with the issue that many of it's technologies could be
better _enabled_ by formalizing a initiative specific to them.

These initiatives sprout up (_often informally_) when a specific technology
requires either a significant number of dedicated individuals, is managed as
separate code repositories, requires a significant amount of independent
knowledge management or any combination of these.

This is what I'm collectively calling **Special Initiatives**.

<<<

== icon:th-list[] Well Established Initiatives

* AlloyUI
* Liferay Faces
* Mobile SDK

<<<

== icon:th-list[] New Initiatives

Recently, 3 new initiatives have been started.

* Single Page Applications
* Liferay Screens
* Standalone Applications

<<<

== icon:th-list[] Single Page Applications

* blah

<<<

== icon:th-list[] Liferay Screens

* blah

<<<

== icon:th-list[] Standalone Applications

* leverage existing skill set
* embrace polyglot
* break from portlet model
* break from portal UI model

<<<

== icon:th-list[] Services

Services are the glue linking all of these initiatives together. Whether local
or remote, contracts based on services offer the most flexible and maintainable
programing model for loosely coupled and dynamic modules.

<<<

== icon:th-list[] Tools

We're expanding our tooling goals toward being IDE agnostic with a heavy focus
on reusable components.

* Rely much more on industry provided tools (outreach to external projects)
* Create small reusable Liferay specific tools (attract interest)
* Enable assembly in order to satisfy many more needs
* [big]**DON'T STOP AT 80%**

<<<

== icon:th-list[] Conclusion

Liferay has long embraced polyglot development (_even before it was a thing_)
and we're taking measures to ensure this is properly enabled within the
platform.

Our current strategy is driven by the desire to provide developers with the very
best experience possible; enabling their already considerable knowledge to be
**_losslessly_** transitioned onto the Liferay platform ensuring the most cost
effective use of talent.

A Personal mission to **Make Developers Happy!!!**
